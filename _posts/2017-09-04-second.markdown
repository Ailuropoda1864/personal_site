Now we are reaching the stage where real work must begin.
I write these posts as filler in order to see what the web page will look like when Fei does the real work.
Of course, I have to put enough jibberish in here to take up enough space.

Now let's have another paragraph.
What's on your mind?
I've got nothing.
Well, there are some pretty nice panda banners strewn about this site.
Yes, I wonder who took those?
Pandas are very photogenic.

That's all for this week's filler, folks.
Come back next week, when all this crap is gone and Fei has put real blog posts here.
