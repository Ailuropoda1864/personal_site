In this blog I'll share a few plotting functions I regularly use.

### Scatter Plot with Linear Fit

I originally wrote this function to plot scatter plots of two variables plus a linearly fitted line.
But later I realized `seaborn` already has [`regplot`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.regplot.html#seaborn.regplot){:target="_blank"} and [`lmplot`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.lmplot.html#seaborn.lmplot){:target="_blank"} that do the same thing but better.
You can read more about them in [this tutorial](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/regression.html){:target="_blank"} (and learn not to re-invent the wheel!).
I have repurposed it to visualize model evaluation.
When your `y` is a continuous variable, you can plot the predicted `y` values on one axis, and the actual `y` values on another, and see how well they line up along `y=x`. To plot the `y=x` line, simply set `slope=1`, `y_intercept=0`.

Here is an example:

### Correlation Heatmap

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Ailuropoda1864/e2e62b19b6a0fd75048fa0c50eda6b69.js"></script>

This is a wrapper function for `seaborn`'s [`heatmap`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html){:target="_blank"}. I use it to look at the correlations between variables in a pandas DataFrame, which is quite useful during exploratory data analysis.

Here is an example:

When you see highly correlated variables, you have to be very careful if you are using a linear regression model (the LINE assumptions!). Plotting a heatmap is a quick way to check for that.
